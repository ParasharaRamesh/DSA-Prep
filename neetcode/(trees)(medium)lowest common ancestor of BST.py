'''
Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree p and q, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a tree T such that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.

Example 1:



Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 8

Output: 5
Example 2:



Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 4

Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 3 and 4 is 3, since a node can be a descendant of itself.

Constraints:

2 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
p != q
p and q will both exist in the BST.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        if p.val > q.val:
            p, q = q, p

        if root.val == p.val or root.val == q.val:
            return root

        if p.val < root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return root

        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val and root.left:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)

        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val and root.right:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        return None

'''
1. can hash the ids of the nodes also in both paths
2. can use a two pointer technique if parent pointers are there and both go towards root and when one exhausts jump to the other one. Eventually things will sync up and you will find the common LCA
