What is it?

. A monotonic stack is a stack (LIFO structure) that maintains its elements in a monotonically increasing or decreasing order.
. A monotonically increasing stack ensures that each element is greater than or equal to the previous one. => next/previous smaller elements
. A monotonically decreasing stack ensures that each element is less than or equal to the previous one. => next/previous greater elements

When is it useful?

. You need to find next greater/next smaller/previous greater/previous smaller elements.
. You need an efficient way (better than brute force O(n^2) to process ranges or sub-arrays.
. Since each element is pushed and popped at most once, monotonic stack solutions run in O(n) time complexity.
. Constraints mentioning array size up to 10^5 or higher (indicating O(nÂ²) won't work). (due to 10^8 computations limit)
